# Crypto-Deribit-Analysis: Code Analysis and Improvements

## Overview of Issues Found and Fixes Applied

After a comprehensive review of the Crypto-Deribit-Analysis repository, I've identified several issues that need attention. This document outlines the problems found and the fixes implemented to improve code reliability, maintainability, and functionality.

## 1. Project Structure Issues

### Problems:
- **Inconsistent imports**: Some modules use absolute imports from `src.anomaly_option` while others use relative imports
- **Missing CLI module**: The `setup.py` references a non-existent `cli.py` module
- **Inconsistent package organization**: Some functionality is duplicated across multiple files

### Fixes:
- Standardized imports to use the correct package structure
- Created a proper CLI module in `src/anomaly_option/cli.py`
- Refactored duplicated code to use proper imports instead of code duplication
- Organized package directories with appropriate `__init__.py` files

## 2. Date Handling Issues

### Problems:
- Inconsistent date handling across the codebase
- Missing implementation for parsing relative dates (e.g., "7d") mentioned in help text
- Potential for errors when converting between date objects and strings

### Fixes:
- Added a robust `parse_date()` function that handles:
  - Standard date strings (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Relative dates (e.g., "7d" for 7 days ago)
  - "today" as a keyword
  - Date objects passed directly
- Standardized date handling across the codebase

## 3. Numerical Calculation Issues

### Problems:
- Potential division by zero in several calculations
- Black-Scholes implementation with numerical stability issues
- Missing handling for NaN values in composite volatility calculation

### Fixes:
- Added `safe_divide()` utility function to handle division by zero
- Improved numerical stability in Black-Scholes implementation
- Enhanced composite volatility calculation with proper NaN handling

## 4. Error Handling and Logging Issues

### Problems:
- Insufficient error handling in API requests
- Missing imports in various modules
- Error masking that could hide important errors

### Fixes:
- Improved error handling with more informative error messages
- Added missing imports (`traceback`, `stats`, etc.)
- Enhanced logging to capture and report errors properly

## 5. Configuration Issues

### Problems:
- Incorrect class method implementation in `Config.from_args()`
- References to undefined properties
- Setup_logging function called after using the logger

### Fixes:
- Fixed class method implementation
- Added checks for undefined properties
- Reordered logger initialization

## 6. Missing Functionality

### Problems:
- No interactive dashboard for visualization and analysis
- Limited options for analysis and data exploration

### Fixes:
- Added a comprehensive Streamlit dashboard with:
  - Interactive price and volatility visualization
  - Anomaly detection visualization
  - Options data analysis
  - Configuration parameters for analysis

## Streamlit Dashboard Implementation

A new Streamlit dashboard has been created to provide an interactive interface for the analysis system. Key features include:

### 1. Analysis Parameters Configuration
- Symbol selection
- Date range picker
- Volatility window settings
- Z-score threshold adjustment
- Toggle for options data inclusion

### 2. Visualization Sections
- **Price & Volatility**: Interactive charts of price movements and volatility metrics
- **Anomalies**: Visualization of detected anomalies with statistics and detailed information
- **Options Analysis**: Options volume charts, implied volatility skew, and other options metrics

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- Clear explanations of parameters
- Sample data visualization when no analysis is run
- Responsive layout

## How to Run the Dashboard

1. Install the package with the fixes:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

2. Run the Streamlit dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run src/anomaly_option/dashboard/streamlit_app.py
```

## Conclusion

The implemented fixes address fundamental issues in the codebase and add substantial new functionality through the Streamlit dashboard. These improvements enhance the reliability, usability, and value of the Crypto-Deribit-Analysis system.

The dashboard provides an accessible interface for traders, analysts, and researchers to explore cryptocurrency price volatility and options data without requiring extensive coding knowledge.
